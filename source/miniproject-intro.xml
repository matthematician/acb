    <p><em>What happens on the journey from data to a decision?</em> This is the central question that motivates us in applied business calculus, and this first <q>mini-project</q> is an opportunity to take that journey on a small scale.</p>
    <p>In this project, your goal is to write a draft of a short business plan for your own (presumably fictitious) sole proprietorship. Using real data, you'll identify a trend that you think has profit potential in the next 3-5 years; a seemingly-unrelated <em>and yet highly correlated</em> trend that tracks it closely; and put together a proposal to capitalize on them both.</p>
    <p>The goal of this mini-project is to become accustomed to the data-driven process of decision-making, from data sourcing and collection, to data entry and modeling using <em>Excel</em>, to analysis and communication of your results in written form.</p>
