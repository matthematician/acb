        <title>Total &amp; Marginal Revenue</title>

        <introduction><p>After the previous two Decision Reports you now have a full understanding of the demand for your product --- that is, you've modeled the relationship between the price point you charge <m>p</m> and the total number of sales quantity in the national market at that price <m>q</m>, and that relationship is captured in the demand function <m>p = D(q)</m>.</p>
        <p>The next step is to go beyond demand and construct function models for <term>sales revenue</term>, defined as the total dollar amount that would be collected from selling <m>q</m> units at a price of <m>p</m> dollars each: <me>R(q) = q\cdot p = q\cdot D(q)</me>
        We'll also ultimately want a function model for the <term>total cost</term> of production <m>C(q)</m>, so that at any given production quantity we can compare revenue and cost to determine the net <term>profit</term>, which is defined to be their difference: <me>P(q) = R(q) - C(q)</me> (In other words, profit is the amount of money your firm can "keep" after paying a total cost of <m>C(q)</m> dollars to produce <m>q</m> units and then collecting <m>R(q)</m> dollars of revenue from selling those units.)</p>
        <p>The key tool in the next decision is "marginal analysis:" the study not only of the functions' values themselves, but of how those values <em>change</em> in response to changes in quantity. At a certain level of production <m>q</m>, would increasing production have a positive effect on sales revenue (if so, we would say that "marginal revenue is positive")? Or a negative effect ("marginal revenue is negative")? </p>
        <proposition>
            <title>Decision Report 3</title>
            <statement>
                <p>At which of your target markets' price points is the marginal sales revenue for your product positive? Negative? In which market(s) are the prices and quantities closest to those that would lead to a <em>maximum</em> in sales revenue?

                <title>Derivatives: The Why</title>

   <p>We could begin this discussion by focusing again on the demand function from our previous Decision Reports. What can we learn from how this function <em>changes</em> from one point to the next, that is, how a change in the independent variable quantity (<m>q</m>) effects a change in the dependent variable price (<m>p = D(q)</m>)?</p>

            <p>In this interactive's default state it shows that, if <m>q=400</m> thousand units of my product are being produced, and if I were to <em>increase</em> my production quantity, I would need to <em>decrease</em> my unit price in order to sell them all. Specifically, <mdn><mrow xml:id="marginal-demand">\text{For each additional thousand units I produce, I'd have to drop the unit price by \$0.37.}</mrow></mdn> We call this a "marginal" analysis, or a computation of the marginal demand function.</p>

                    <p>Let <m>f(q)</m> be a function whose independent variable is <m>q</m>, the quantity of a product or service produced for sale.</p>
                    <p>The <term>marginal function</term> <m>Mf(q)</m> measures the amount this function's value would <em>change</em> as a result of <em>increasing</em> the production <m>q</m> by a single unit.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>This is typically defined for <m>f</m> being demand, revenue, cost, or profit. For example, if <m>f = R</m> is a revenue function, then <m>MR(60) = </m> "at a production of <m>q=60</m> thousand units, how much revenue would be earned by producing 'one more' unit?"</p>
                </description>
            </definition>

            <p>Referring back to the marginal demand computation in <xref ref="marginal-demand"/>, where we found in our example that <m>MD(400) \approx -0.37</m>, we'll see next that this quantity can be expressed and communicated in four important ways: <ol><li>Numerically, as a rate of change: "<m>-\$0.37</m> per thousand units of increase."</li><li>Graphically, as the <em>slope</em> of the demand graph at <m>q=400</m>, or more specifically the slope of a line drawn tangent to the grpah at this point, as in the purple line below: <image source="img/demandgraph-slope.png" width="80%"/></li><li>In writing, as in <xref ref="marginal-demand"/>, and lastly,</li><li>In a formula, by deriving an expression for <m>MD(q)</m> and then evaluating it at <m>q=400</m>. Just how we <em>get</em> that formula is the subject of <xref ref="decision3-math"/>.</li></ol></p>

            <p>Let's turn our attention to the revenue function, to prepare for the upcoming decision report. What can we learn from marginal analysis of the revenue function, using each of the Rule of Four (<xref ref="derivs-four"/>)?</p>

        <subsection xml:id="decision3-proj">
            <title>Decision Report 3</title>

            <p>In your previous decision report (<xref ref="decision2-proj" />), your team determined a quadratic function <m>p = D(q)</m> which best fits the demand relationship between quantity of items sold <m>q</m> (in thousands) and sale price <m>p</m> (in dollars per unit) on the national market for your product. This function looked something like the example below:
            <me> p = D(q) = -0.0000535\, q^2 - 0.034403\, q + 414.535. </me></p>
    
            <p>This relationship between price and quantity permits your team to also determine the <term>sales revenue</term> --- that is, the total amount of income your company would take in from sales --- at each quantity. This is also a function <m>R(q)</m>, defined as the amount of money earned by selling <m>q</m> thousand units at a price of <m>p</m> dollars per unit. In other words, revenue is quantity multiplied by price, but price is given by your demand function: in this example,
            <me> R(q) = q\, p = q \bigl( -0.0000535\, q^2 - 0.034403\, q + 414.535 \bigr) </me>
    
    (Because <m>q</m> is measured in thousands of units, <m>R(q)</m> is measured in thousands of dollars.)</p>
    
    <p>Meanwhile, the <term>marginal revenue</term> at a given quantity refers to the <em>additional</em> amount of revenue that would be earned by producing one <em>additional</em> unit of your product. More precisely, marginal revenue is the (instantaneous) rate of change of revenue with respect to a change in quantity, which is the derivative:
    
    <me> MR(q) \quad {\it or} \quad R'(q) = -0.0001605\, q^2 - 0.068806\, q + 414.535. </me></p>
    
    <p>Marginal revenue, being a slope on the graph of <m>q</m> in thousands of units vs. <m>R</m> in thousands of dollars, has units of dollars per unit. Because it is its derivative, <m>MR</m> can tell you whether and how much an increase in quantity will increase revenue (if <m>MR</m> is positive), or decrease revenue (if <m>MR</m> is negative).</p>
    
    
    <p>Now that you've done some analysis, the project lead who was responsible for the test marketing data wants a status report. What does each of the test markets predict about total revenue on the national market?</p>
